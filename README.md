# react-code-blocks-httpsnippet

I decided to create this project because of being frustrated of lack of personalization abilities of [Kong/react-apiembed](https://github.com/Kong/react-apiembed). I went with [httpsnippet](https://github.com/kong/httpsnippet) (which is the core of react-apiembed) and [react-code-blocks](https://github.com/rajinwonderland/react-code-blocks). Added just a sprinkle of react-boostrap on top and created something more pleasant to the eye.

Here's the demo:<br>
